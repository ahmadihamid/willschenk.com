Lets use elfeed-org to keep track of our feeds, and then we'll use elfeed to actually read them.  Lets go!

=M-x package-install RET elfeed-org= and =M-x package-install RET elfeed-goodies=

Stick this in your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'elfeed-org)
(require 'elfeed-goodies)

(elfeed-goodies/setup)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-x w") 'elfeed)

#+end_src
