I love the feeling of the airplanes doors closing for departure. Packing, wrapping up loose ends, getting through security and the boarding process, all leads up to the moment when you detach from the day-to-day and get up in the air to a new place. If you haven't taken care if it yet, once those doors close there's really nothing you can do about it.

I tend to travel a fair amount for work within the States, and to Europe a couple times a year to visit family and friends. We just got back from a trip to Nigeria which reminded me of my first real taste of third world travel in the 90s, here are some tips.

## Finances and Paperwork

Be rich. The more money you have access to the less thouroughly you need to plan, the less you need to bring with you, and the less time you will spend waiting. You can travel relatively cheaply if you let go of all sense of time and urgency, and don't mind being uncomfotable because the journey is the destination.

I used to travel like that and I miss it. This is part of why I was really interested in Nigeria. We had one flight delayed 7 hours and another delayed 11 hours, which if that's what you signed up for then great. If you are looking to relax, or looking to get some business done however, money makes a huge difference.

You should always have at least two cards on you, better also to have a debit card in addition to credit cards. Credit Cards are preferable in general since you can contest charges, but American cards don't work in a lot of places. You'll be happy when rolling into a gas station in Iceland or Norway trying to fill your tank to have a pin-based debit card to fall back on.

Outside of the US, I generally withdrawl the largest amount of local currency the ATM will give me upon landing. This tends to be the equivlent of "$200" depending, but could be up to $500 or as little as $30, but it's a good rule of thumb. 

US travelers generally have the easiest time in the world when it comes to getting a Visa into a country. Check and make sure before hand that you can get one on arrival, and if not give yourself a few weeks to sort it out before. If there is any doubt, get a local expeditor to help navigate (see be rich, above.) I'm based out of NYC so we have both consulates and direct flights to everywhere; if you aren't in one of the big US cities give yourself ample time to sort this out before hand.  Expeditors can also help you get a passport if you don't have one yet.

Check the state department websites and the CDC website to see what you are getting into. I find them both to be overly alarmist, but you should familiarize yourself with what they say. The more terrifying it is the more you should plan ahead and try and get local contacts. But if you are going to Europe or South East Asia or somewhere industrially developed it's not really a big deal.

For more exotic locales you'll need to get a WHO vacination card. Information on the internet is very conflicting about what is needed or recommended; just get everything.

## Luggage and Package

Your bag should be soft, so you can squeeze it under the seat if needed or cram it into an over stuffed overhead bin, and it should have shoulder straps to use as a backpack. I don't like rolling bags because you lose the use of a hand while maneuvering through the airport. Better to check in with your boarding pass in one hand with a cup of coffee in the other.

Winter travel is much harder than in temperate and tropical zones, since everything is so bulky.

I travel as light as possible, generally only with a single backpack.
