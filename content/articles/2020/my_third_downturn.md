I was born in 1977 and started working in 1991 when I was 14 in the computer center of my schools district office. This was after school mainly, and I remember "14" because I ran into a whole bunch of child labor laws about how many hours I could actually put on my time-sheet, which I thought was preposterous at the time because playing with the minicomputers was so much more engaging than what was happening in class.  Eventually I went away to school that gave me college credits at 16 to get out of the high-school, and then once I had enough credits I transferred to Penn State to work at the computer center at 17. 

I like to say that they the administrators and my parents did an end-run to trick me into enrolling as a student, but the fact of the matter was while I always had good grades I couldn't even pretend to take these institutions rules seriously.  I was a pain in the ass, and at that point I didn't (and still don't) have a high school diploma.  Now that I have 3 little children of my own I'm sure I'll get to fully appreciate what I put my parents through.

I started working just because it was more fun than school.  They paid me but money was never a driver.  To be totally explicit, my family was rich before and I am rich now.  This is not tale of woe or hard times.
