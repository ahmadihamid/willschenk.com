Books and reading are a big part of my life. When a book hits you at the right time, ringing in your soul, it can resonate out in the harmony of how you conceive of the world and your place in it.  Sometimes the book isn't even considered good by the chattering classes but in the right place and the right time is can be just want you need.

On a slow week I read about 2 books; normally it's around 5. I go back and forth between paper copies and kindle-on-my-phone, but I vastly prefer soft cover books. The physical experience of hardcover books -- especially if the kids destroy the dust cover so the marketing flashiness is stripped away, which happens a lot in our house hold but feels like it violates the book's integrity -- makes them seem more important and timeless than they are, but softcover books are way more pleasant to actually, you know, read.

Most books are pop junk. Both Joy and I like to get things from the bibliography of the books that we read, which means that there are a lot of old books in our house.  I'll get things that were from back in the 60s and 70s, though she will often go back to the 17Th and 18Th century, but she reads in 5 languages and I'm limited to English. There's a minor industry of poorly typeset public domain books that you can order printed which gives you a sense of how active the forgetting process is.

Jane Austin was considered to be in the to-be-forgotten pop junk category for a while but clearly not anymore, so it's not like all of these things are forgotten for a just reason; they are just forgotten. People think that Amazon sells a lot of books but compared to a good library their selection is both surprisingly broad and incredibly superficial.

Most of the big events in my life therefor have books associated with them. Good or bad, the experience of reading them triggered something in my mind that I associate with the resulting change in my life. Some books I take thoughts directly from but more often the books create a space that my thoughts roam around in -- I have no allegiage to the fidelity of the authors intent, and coming out of a book saying "everything this author is saying is wrong" still gives you something valuable. More often than not it's "this confused drivel isn't even wrong", so you appreciate a clear signal.

Lets get into some good ones.

[Two Little Savages](https://bookshop.org/books/two-little-savages-revised/9780486209852)


[The Portable Nietzsche, edited by Walter Kaufmann](https://bookshop.org/books/the-portable-nietzsche/9780140150629). My aunt give me this when I was 16, which greatly impressed my father. She is now a retired law professor and I always had the impression that my "marching to a drum beat that only I can hear" ways made us aliens to each other, but she was a grown up and I was a little pain in the ass so we can see who the mature one is. Nietzsche is, sort of like Ayn Rand, fundamentally adolescent literature where a large part of the appeal is the the raging against the machine. "Revaluation of all values" makes a lot more sense when you don't have kids or a mortage. (Rand is an embarrising idiot and I managed to dodge that bullet.)

Around this time I decided that I had enough of highschool and went to "early college", where I ended up majoring in Math and Philosphy.  Every 7 or 8 years I will reread most of everything that Nietzsche wrote, and reading at each age in my life you get very different things out of it. It's hard to imagine someone as educated and intelligent as he was being produced in the world that we live in now.  After the 5Th or so reading I feel that I've gotten everything that I can out of it, but I'm sure I'll feel compelled to pick it up again and find something else. When I was younger [Thus Spoke Zarathustra](https://bookshop.org/books/thus-spoke-zarathustra-a-book-for-everyone-and-no-one/9780140441185) spoke the loudest to me, but [The Gay Science](https://bookshop.org/books/the-gay-science-with-a-prelude-in-rhymes-and-an-appendix-of-songs/9780394719856) and [On the Geneology of Morals](https://bookshop.org/books/on-the-genealogy-of-morals-and-ecce-homo/9780679724629) strike a better balance of genius and madness.

Buddhism was big in our household and I read quite a lot of that, but the biggest influence is more Taoism than Buddhism. [Chuang Tzu](https://bookshop.org/books/chuang-tzu-basic-writings-revisedp/9780231105958) has the "I had a dream that I was a butterfly, and when I awoke I didn't know if I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming than I was a man" zinger in it. In many ways Chuang Tzu and the [Tao Te Ching](https://bookshop.org/books/lao-tzu-tao-te-ching-a-book-about-the-way-and-the-power-of-the-way/9781611807240)
