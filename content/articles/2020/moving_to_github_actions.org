I guess I was using a very old version of CircleCI's config file, and it silently stopped working for me.  The new config file seemed confusing, so lets move it over to [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub Actions]].

* Create a =.github/workflow.yml= file

I'm going to use the [[https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-to-gh-pages][hugo-to-gh-pages]] action.

#+begin_src yml :tangle workflow.yml
name: Publish Site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish Site
        uses: chabad360/hugo-gh-pages@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
          hugoVersion: extended_0.69.0
#+end_src
