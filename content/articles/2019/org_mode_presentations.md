I love org mode.  Here's a way to make a simple presentation with it.

## Install `reveal.js` and `org-reveal`

You can put this wherever you want, I'm sticking it in the home directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
```

Then fire up emails, and `M-x p-ins org-reveal`.
