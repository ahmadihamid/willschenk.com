Putting things in scripts makes it easy to get up and running quickly.  Devops isn't just for servers or `Dockerfile`s, you can also use it for your own environment.  This is the script that I use to get my Chromebooks up and running after a wipe and how I get a new OSX machine up an running.  Lets use the [bash boilerplate](https://bash3boilerplate.sh/) to write our script.
