# New site

Been moving away from the ruby ecosystem and exploring static sites with hugo.

1. No asset pipeline
2. Simple server setup
3. Semantic web is under threat by SPA, just a mess of javascript.

## Also Medium

Time to go back to owning the sites

```bash
#!/bin/bash

hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 -D --baseUrl=http://100.115.92.205:1313/ --watch
```
