I cofounded [HappyFunCorp](https://happyfuncorp.com "HappyFunCorp") in 2009.  We do product engineering for individuals, startups, growing companies and established concerns.  We've launched over 200 products.  We've learned a lot.

This site is about product engineering from the technology perspective and other things that I find interesting.

I have three children and a dog.
