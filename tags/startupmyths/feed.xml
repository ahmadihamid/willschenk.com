      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you all remember the movie. A man whose normal life is starting to fall apart. He&amp;rsquo;s got the wife, family, mortgage and it&amp;rsquo;s both not enough and slipping away. He needs to do something, something to make him feel alive. And since it was that era of Hollywood film making, he&amp;rsquo;s also got plenty of daddy issues he&amp;rsquo;s working through. He becomes seized by a vision, caught in the grip of an id√©e fixe that he needs to go build something that everyone around him thinks is preposterous.</description>
