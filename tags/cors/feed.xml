      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of web development old school, just editing HTML and JavaScript by hand without a build environment. Running npx live-server is an easy one liner to spin up a server, that opens a browser for you and also updates changes on safe.  Sometimes that&amp;#39;s not enough. Often you want to pull in data from an API, and that requires HTTPS, and also you need to work around CORS limitations.</description>
