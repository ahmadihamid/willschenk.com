There&amp;rsquo;s no obvious way to export this from the application, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have a published interface. Lets look at hope to use chrome developer tools to figure out what the API is.
We know that PocketCasts must have an API since it also has a mobile app &amp;ndash; the code in the mobile app must talk to the code in the server using a format that computers understand, which is basically the definition of an API.</description></item><item><title>Easy scraping with httpie and jq</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/easy_scraping_with_httpie_and_jq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/easy_scraping_with_httpie_and_jq/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently saw a tweet mentioning the combination of using &lt;a href="https://httpie.org/">HTTPie&lt;/a> (a command line HTTP client), &lt;a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq&lt;/a> (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor) and &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron">Gron&lt;/a> (Make JSON greppable!) was &amp;ldquo;all you needed to build a scraper.&amp;rdquo; Lets see if that&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
