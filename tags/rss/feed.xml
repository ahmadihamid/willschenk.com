Old school. I was looking at the list of things that I&amp;#39;ve subscribed to which has been imported back from the Google Reader days, and figured I&amp;#39;d do some exploration of ye old OPML file. Setup the Gemfile We&amp;#39;ll need to pull in a few gems here: source &amp;#39;https://rubygems.org&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;httparty&amp;#39; # To pull stuff from the network gem &amp;#39;feedjira&amp;#39; # To parse RSS feeds gem &amp;#39;nokogiri&amp;#39; # To parse XML gem &amp;#39;domainator&amp;#39; # To figured out the domain from the hostname gem &amp;#39;whois&amp;#39; # To see how old the domain is gem &amp;#39;whois-parser&amp;#39; # To actually make sense of the result And install everything bundle Look at domains First, lets see what we can find out about the machine that hosts the feed.</description></item></channel></rss>
