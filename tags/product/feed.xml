      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a certain user interface that, when you first see it, screams out of you that it was designed by an engineer.
(via Daring Fireball User Interface of the Week)
Why does that happen? What is it in the nature of engineering or software development process that leads to user interfaces that are impossible for the users to actually use?
Perfect Storm of User Discontent The short version:
 The most interesting part of engineer&amp;rsquo;s jobs is the obsession with the possibilities in the solution space - all the cool shit you can make computers do.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you all remember the movie. A man whose normal life is starting to fall apart. He&amp;rsquo;s got the wife, family, mortgage and it&amp;rsquo;s both not enough and slipping away. He needs to do something, something to make him feel alive. And since it was that era of Hollywood film making, he&amp;rsquo;s also got plenty of daddy issues he&amp;rsquo;s working through. He becomes seized by a vision, caught in the grip of an id√©e fixe that he needs to go build something that everyone around him thinks is preposterous.</description>
