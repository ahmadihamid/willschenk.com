      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to update seed, which is HappyFunCorp&amp;rsquo;s app generator to make it easy to kick off MVPs. Check out the website for more information. One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve started to do is to seperate out the dependancies more, and being tutorials on how to use each of the different features. After I link to that stuff, let&amp;rsquo;s walk through a way to combine different techniques we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed together.</description>

      <description>The goal is to get features out fast, and iterate on them quickly. Does anyone care about it? What do they care about? How do we make it better?
As projects get bigger, both in terms of people using the site as well as people working on the site, testing and quality become relatively more important. Adding tests introduces drag, and the theory is that you invest now for payoffs later.</description>

      <title>Setting up Devise with Twitter and Facebook and other Omniauth schemes without email addresses</title>

      <description>Adding social login to your sites really makes it easier to get users onboard. Devise is great to help get an authentication system up and running, but there are a few tricky things to get right. The first challenge is that you don&amp;rsquo;t always get the user&amp;rsquo;s email address when the first connect. The second challenge is that we want to request the minimum permissions first so that the user is more likely to sign up, and gradually ask more as the time arises.</description>
