      <description>I found a tutorial on how to manage your dotfiles, that works by splitting up the git repository (normally the .git directory) from the work directory. Since I have a lot of code that I put in my tutorials, I adapted the technique to have individual article directories mirrored in their own github repository.
Repositories and Work Directories The normal usage of git is to type git clone &amp;lt;remote&amp;gt; to get a copy of the local directory, mess with stuff, and then add and commit your changes.</description>
