      <description>Markdown is a nice format to write it, but sometimes you need to add HTML classes directly to the output to make it look how you want. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to do that using hugo shortcodes.
Create a table shortcode Put this in /layouts/shortcodes/table.html:
{{ $htmlTable := .Inner | markdownify }} {{ $class := .Get 0 }} {{ $old := &amp;#34;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&amp;#34; }} {{ $new := printf &amp;#34;&amp;lt;table class=\&amp;#34;%s\&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34; $class }} {{ $htmlTable := replace $htmlTable $old $new }} {{ $htmlTable | safeHTML }} Create a table Like this:</description>

      <description>I often want to show small changes I&amp;rsquo;m making to a file and it would be nice for hugo to support styling patches directly. Lets see what we can do to make this process easier.
Lets take the example of create node package.json file and add the following scripts worflow. How can we say this different than &amp;ldquo;copy this into your package.json file&amp;rdquo;?
Create sample steps Lets first create the file using npm init -y and then immediately cp package.</description>

      <title>Using Org Mode in Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m learning org-mode and I don&amp;#39;t really know what I&amp;#39;m doing, but this is how I&amp;#39;m trying out writing hugo posts with it. I&amp;#39;m used to markdown, so this is a what&amp;#39;s different post. Some minor org-mode tweaks   For some reason when org-mode starts it doesn&amp;#39;t softwrap the paragragh text. I like to have it soft-wrapped so everything is on the screen if it&amp;#39;s not collapsed. Also having some nice indentation makes things visually cleaner, so add this snippet to your ~/.</description>

      <title>Splitting Git Repos and Work Directories</title>
      <link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/splitting_git_repos_and_workdirectories/</link>

      <description>I found a tutorial on how to manage your dotfiles, that works by splitting up the git repository (normally the .git directory) from the work directory. Since I have a lot of code that I put in my tutorials, I adapted the technique to have individual article directories mirrored in their own github repository.
Repositories and Work Directories The normal usage of git is to type git clone &amp;lt;remote&amp;gt; to get a copy of the local directory, mess with stuff, and then add and commit your changes.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a tweet mentioning the combination of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://httpie.org/&#34;&gt;HTTPie&lt;/a&gt; (a command line HTTP client), &lt;a href=&#34;https://stedolan.github.io/jq/&#34;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt; (a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron&#34;&gt;Gron&lt;/a&gt; (Make JSON greppable!) was &amp;ldquo;all you needed to build a scraper.&amp;rdquo;  Lets see if that&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Just because we have a static site doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we can&amp;rsquo;t have an admin tool to write and edit posts! Lets go through how we can add the NetlifyCMS to the site and host it wherever we want.
In my case I&amp;rsquo;m storing the code on GitHub and also serving the pages from GitHub Pages. Netlify also seems like a really promising company with a number of other services that they offer, so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check it out.</description>

      <description>Now that&amp;rsquo;s its 2018 its time to retool the blog using hugo. Why not? Hugo is built in golang and is blazing fast and everything is cleaner than it was in the middleman years.
One of the reasons that I liked middleman &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s usage of the rails&amp;rsquo; Sprockets library &amp;ndash; is no longer a strength. The javascript and front-end world has moved over to WebPack and I&amp;rsquo;ve personally moved over to create-react-app.</description>
