      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s a simple CircleCI configuration to pull down the latest version of your hugo site on GitHub commits, build it, and then push it to github pages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Just because we have a static site doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we can&amp;rsquo;t have an admin tool to write and edit posts! Lets go through how we can add the NetlifyCMS to the site and host it wherever we want.
In my case I&amp;rsquo;m storing the code on GitHub and also serving the pages from GitHub Pages. Netlify also seems like a really promising company with a number of other services that they offer, so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to check it out.</description>

      <description>Now that&amp;rsquo;s its 2018 its time to retool the blog using hugo. Why not? Hugo is built in golang and is blazing fast and everything is cleaner than it was in the middleman years.
One of the reasons that I liked middleman &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s usage of the rails&amp;rsquo; Sprockets library &amp;ndash; is no longer a strength. The javascript and front-end world has moved over to WebPack and I&amp;rsquo;ve personally moved over to create-react-app.</description>
