      <description>Syncthing is a way to keep things up-to-date across machines without going through any 3rd party servers. You get both backup and file synchronization without pesky servers just using the computer capacity you probably already have laying around. Lets give it a spin. Installation on Debian   On the Getting Started page of syncthing they recommend using a GUI package, but we&amp;#39;re going to install on debian on the command line.</description>

      <description>Cabal is a &amp;ldquo;experimental p2p community chat platform&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed over the dat protocol. When you create a new chat area &amp;ndash; something like a Slack &amp;ndash; it allows anyone with the same key to post and view messages everywhere. When you post a message, everyone gets it and shares it with everyone else, so even when your computer drops off there will still be a coherent view of the data.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://microformats.org/&#34;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt;?  Me neither!
