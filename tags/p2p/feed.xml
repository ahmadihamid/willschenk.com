Here&amp;#39;s how to do it. Overview Create a server &amp;amp; name Install docker Create the docker image Setup directories, config, and easy shell commands Start up a container Publish yourself as a pub Connect your client Create a server I&amp;#39;m using debian 10 on digital ocean, but I&amp;#39;ll let you get the system on the internet.</description></item><item><title>Effigy, a distributed social data layer</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/effigy_social_data_layer/</guid><description>I grew up in the world of BBSes, Usenet, and, to some extent, UUCP before that. This was fun â€“ a world wide network all built up by volunteers sharing. Since we are all carrying supercomputers around now with massive idle storage and bandwidth, let&amp;#39;s think about how we can recreate some of that fun, independent data sharing with modern web technologies, specifically Websockets and WebRTC. All you need is the computer that you already have with you.</description></item><item><title>Using Syncthing</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_syncthing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/using_syncthing/</guid><description>Syncthing is a way to keep things up-to-date across machines without going through any 3rd party servers. You get both backup and file synchronization without pesky servers just using the computer capacity you probably already have laying around. Lets give it a spin. Installation on Debian On the Getting Started page of syncthing they recommend using a GUI package, but we&amp;#39;re going to install on debian on the command line.</description></item><item><title>Playing with cabal</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/playing_with_cabal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/playing_with_cabal/</guid><description>Cabal is a &amp;ldquo;experimental p2p community chat platform&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed over the dat protocol. When you create a new chat area &amp;ndash; something like a Slack &amp;ndash; it allows anyone with the same key to post and view messages everywhere. When you post a message, everyone gets it and shares it with everyone else, so even when your computer drops off there will still be a coherent view of the data.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Indieweb Homepage</title><link>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_indieweb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/setting_up_indieweb/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats&lt;/a>?
