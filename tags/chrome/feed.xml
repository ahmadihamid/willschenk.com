      <description>I want to get a list of all of the podcast episodes that I&amp;rsquo;ve starred on PocketCasts. There&amp;rsquo;s no obvious way to export this from the application, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have a published interface. Lets look at hope to use chrome developer tools to figure out what the API is.
We know that PocketCasts must have an API since it also has a mobile app &amp;ndash; the code in the mobile app must talk to the code in the server using a format that computers understand, which is basically the definition of an API.</description>
