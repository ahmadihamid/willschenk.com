      <description>IPFS is cool. It&amp;rsquo;s a peer to peer distributed file system, or graph database, where you reference the data by its hash. This has the great property that the data is no longer tied to a particular computer or server. It can be spread around and you can get it from anybody without worrying if they&amp;rsquo;ve changed or alterted it in any way. If you know what you are looking for, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about who you get it from.</description>
