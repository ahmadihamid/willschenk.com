      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recipe for getting a blank react project with bootstrap up and running. We&amp;rsquo;ll walk though all of the steps that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a basic bootstrap based framework up and running, ready for theming and component implementation using redux.
Steps Install the following packages.
Install node/nvm If you don&amp;rsquo;t have it
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash source ~/.profile nvm install 10 nvm global 10 Install yarn If you are into that</description>

      <title>Building a hugo site and theme with Bootstrap</title>

      <description>Now that&amp;rsquo;s its 2018 its time to retool the blog using hugo. Why not? Hugo is built in golang and is blazing fast and everything is cleaner than it was in the middleman years.
One of the reasons that I liked middleman &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s usage of the rails&amp;rsquo; Sprockets library &amp;ndash; is no longer a strength. The javascript and front-end world has moved over to WebPack and I&amp;rsquo;ve personally moved over to create-react-app.</description>

      <description>We are a big fan of Bootstrap here at HappyFunCorp. While there are some arguments to be made if Bootstrap in particular is all that, or if Foundation is better for a given thing, its clear that starting with some sort of CSS framework is smarter than trying to roll everything yourself. [1]
There are three major complaints with using bootstrap.
 All of the sites look the same. There are so many classes in the HTML where they don&amp;rsquo;t strictly belong It&amp;rsquo;s a whole bunch of stuff that you don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>
