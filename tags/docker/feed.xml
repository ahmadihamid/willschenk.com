      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into Guix and Emacs lately, going back to my Free Software roots. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. Guix is a functional package manager that you can use on top of a linux distribution to have repeatable and rollbackable builds. GuixSD is a distrubution that&amp;rsquo;s Guix all the way down.
I have an Intel NUC lying around that I wanted to use, so this is my effort to get a working GuixSD installation on it.</description>

      <title>Building a slimmer go Docker container</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go binaries are self contained, which means that they don&amp;rsquo;t need anything special installed in the environment to deploy them.  When people make &lt;code&gt;Dockerfiles&lt;/code&gt; to build go projects, they often include the the golang compilers and build tools, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for running the container.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/somarat/healer&#34;&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; Docker container that &amp;ldquo;Automatically heal docker containers that report themselves unhealthy&amp;rdquo; as an example of reducing the image size from 648MB to 17MB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just switch my pixelbook back to the stable channel, and this is what I did to get back to developing on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
